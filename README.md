Pixiv is much better than deviantart. Apply 'Root' to have this wonderful style !

What's an userstyle ?
-------------------------------

Simply put, it's a script with a bunch of pseudo-code that will change the aspect of any website, it's kind like make-up I guess : you'll be able to change/modify the visual of the elements of the page (background, icon, buttons, etc...) and even delete some useless stuff. To use it, there is an add-on called 'Stylish' for the majority of the browser, so if you are on Chrome, Firefox, Opera and such go for it ! I also recommend you to go to userstyles.org (userstyles.org/) where you can found a lot of styles for a lot of website.

What do 'Hope' change ?
-------------------------------

Contrary to the first script called 'Water', I wanted to keep the original layout of the site, headers are bigger and more colorful, changed some icons, removed some stuff, etcetera, you'll discover the rest if you use the script ~

How to install it ?
-------------------------------

After installing 'Stylish', you'll have to 'write a new style', copy/paste the code in 'root.css', name the style and then save ! Before installing it, I suggest you :

* to install the font I used, namely 'Roboto' (www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/rob…), 'Bokutachi no Gothic 2' (www.freejapanesefont.com/bokut…), these two are free !
* download Adblock Plus to kill the ads.
* install GreaseMonkey (for Mozilla) or TamperMonkey (for Google).
* install this script to expand the pixiv thumbnails 'greasyfork.org/en/scripts/5480…, you can play with it by modifying the max-width of the pictures !

Where can I find your works ?
-------------------------------

I have a deviantart page : nicknameisfortheweak.deviantart.com, I also submit my script in pastebin : http://pastebin.com/u/Catgrills

And that's it, I hope you'll enjoy this script if you see this submission ! Like usual, if you have find the script cool or bad, if you have questions, suggestions, there is a section called 'Comments', you can use it everytime !
